# Apache Flink Examples
This is the code repository for the Streaming ETL examples using Apache Flink. 
The blog of first author is located in [dzone](https://dzone.com/users/3382657/preetdeepshrivastava.html).
My [blog](https://aironman2k.wordpress.com).
I will add more examples and i will try to offer the fork to the original author.

Some examples are from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-flink-a-real-time-hands-on-course-on-flink/learn/lecture/12037498#overview), 
adapted to be used in a windows 10 environment.

This project will be updated with new examples. 
For official Flink documentation please visit [https://flink.apache.org/](https://flink.apache.org/)

Original work of Preetdeep Kumar.

### Package - org.pd.streaming.window.example
* It contains various examples of using TumblingWindow to sum integers. More methods.
* A simple IntegerGenerator class is used as source to produce a number every second.
* The example includes TimeWindow with ProcessFunction and CountWindow with ReduceFunction

### Package - org.pd.streaming.state
* It contains an example of using a list to sum integers.
* It contains an example of using a Reduce function to sum all integers.

### Package - org.pd.streaming.aggregation.simple
* It contains simple aggregation logic for Integers and recommended as starting point for beginners. A simple source class which emits 10 continiously increasing integers every second as default.
* This source is then passed to IntegerSum class which creates a StreamingExecutionEnvironment, a data stream and finally executes the environment to start the streaming computation.
* As long as the process is running, it will keep on printing aggregated value of all integers collected by Flink every 5 seconds tumbling window. A tumbling window is very easy to understand is one of many window supported by Flink.
* IntegerSumWithReduce class uses reduce() instead of apply() method to demo the incremental computation feature of Flink.

### Package - org.pd.streaming.aggregation.key
* It contains classes which demo usage of a keyed data stream. Every integer is emitted with a key and passed to Flink using two options: Flink Tuple2 class and a Java POJO.
* The logic is same (compute sum of all integers), however we tell Flink to find a key at an index (Tuple2) or use a getter (POJO). IntegerSumWithKey class uses Tuple2 and IntegerSumWithKeyFromPojo uses a Java POJO class called MyData

### Package - org.pd.streaming.event
* It contains classes which demo usage of Flink CEP API for Event processing. A event here is instance of SensorEvent class which
simulates simple state events from sensors. 
* EventAnalysisCEP class declares a Pattern to identify if a connected_event is immediately followed by disconnected_event within 5 seconds. This pattern is used to create Flink PatternStream which prints matching event if they reach certain threshold.

### Package - org.pd.streaming.application.queue
* It contains classes which demo usage of using ActiveMQ as source. It uses Spring Boot's default in-memory activemq support
and exposes a REST endpoint POST http://localhost:8080/logs to accept messages.
* These messages will be send to queue and Flink will consume it as and when it arrives allowing loose coupling.

## Building this project from Source
Prerequisites:
* Git
* Maven
* Java 8+

```
git clone https://github.com/airoman-indizen/flink-tutorials
cd flink-tutorials
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

(For testing Flink with ActiveMQ example, start application as follows, and POST apache server log message in JSON to http://localhost:8080/logs)
```
java -jar flink-tutorials-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
Sample log data in JSON
```
